{first_name} —

How many hours does your AP team spend every week chasing payments? Sending follow-up emails, making reminder calls, escalating past-due invoices?

Most of my clients tell me 10-15 hours a week — just on follow-up. That is time your people could spend on work that actually moves the business forward.

We automate the entire AP follow-up process. The system sends the right message at the right time — polite reminders at 30 days, firmer follow-ups at 60, escalation at 90. No templates to manage. No one has to remember to send that awkward email.

One of our clients saw their cash flow improve within the first month. Their AP team got those hours back. DSO dropped 12 days.

The service runs $500 to $5,000 a month depending on volume. Most of our clients tell us the ROI shows up on the first call that gets resolved without human involvement.

Would it make sense to walk through how this works for {company_name}? Takes about 15 minutes.
